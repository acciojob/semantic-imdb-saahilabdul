              <b>Summary:</b><br>
              Part 2-The Conclusion of Baahubali begins with Katappa(Sathyaraj) tellling us how he ended up killing Amarendra Bahubali(Prabhas).
  After vanquishing the Kalakeyas, Sivagami(Ramya Krishnan) decides to make Amarendra Bahubali the future king of Mahishmati. It is decided that Bhalla Deva(Rana Daggubati) will be the Commander-in-Chief. Before the coronation, Sivagami tells Amarendra to tour the kingdom to get to know people and also promises him that by the time he is back, she will find him a suitable bride.
  Amarendra visit Kuntala and falls in love with Devasena(Anushka Shetty)the youngers sister of the King of Kuntala. Bhalla Deva learns of Amarendra's attempts to woo Devasena and he decides to drive a wedge between Amarendra and Sivagami by telling his mother that he wants to marry Devasena. Sivagami, unaware that Amarendra is in love with Devasena, promises Bhalla, Devasena's hand in marriage.
  Devasena rejects the marriage proposal because she doesn't like the way the messenger from Maheshmati reads the letter. Sivagami is angry when she hears about Devasena's rebuttal and she orders that Devasena be brought to Mahishmati as a prisoner.
  The kingdom of Kuntala is attacked by Pindaris, who are a dacoit army. Amarendra, with the help of Devasena's cousin Kumara Varma(Subbaraju), nullifies the attack and he manages to save Kuntala. Devasena and Baahubali also join hands in the fight against the Pindaris.
  Devasena realises that Amarendra is no country bumpkin, like he has been pretending to be and that he is the future King of Mahishmati. Amarendra proposes to Devasena, makes her his bride and takes her with him to meet his mother Sivagami.
  Upon reaching Mahismati the misunderstanding comes to light. When Sivagami delivers an ultimatum to Amarendra that he must either chose the throne or Devasena, he chooses Devasena. Bhalladeva is crowned king and Amarendra is made the Commander-in-Chief, but it's quite obvious that Amarendra is still popular with the people of the Kingdom, who keep rooting for him, screaming ``Baahubali, Baahubali.''
  At Devasena's baby shower, Bhalla Deva relieves Amarendra of his duties as Commander-in-chief so that he can be with his wife. Devasena who has her own mind, speaks sharply about the King's guile and she also points out how Sivagami doesn't bother taking up for Amarendra or for what is actually right. Due to further clashes, Devasena and Amarendra are banished from the Palace. Amarendra and Devasena live happily among the people. Bhallaladeva hatches a plot to convince Sivagami that Amarendra is trying to assassinate him. Sivagami falls for Bhallaladeva's lie and she asks her faithful Katappa to kill her foster son, Baahubali. Katappa stabs Baahubali in the back.
  Katappa learns of Bhallaladeva's treachery and informs Sivagami. Devasena too learns of her husband's death. She is distraught but she knows she must save her son at any cost. She puts Mahendra Bahubali in Sivagami's hands. Sivagami eyes are open; she realises that she has been tricked by her own husband and son. She picks up the newborn in her arms and announces to the people that the baby, Mahendra, is the new King.
  As Bhalladeva and his men are about to seize the Queen, she flees with baby Mahendra Bahubali and Devasena is taken prisoner for next 25 years.
  After listening to whole story Mahendra Bahubali/Shivudu(Prabhas in a dual role) decides to avenge his father's death by raising his own army with the help of Kattappa and returns to Mahishmati. Bhalladeva once again kidnaps Devasena and seals the palace, but Bahubali wise as his father was, manages to enter the palace to capture BhallalaDeva. BijjalDeva tries to brainwash Kattappa, that he should only be loyal to the king, to which Kattappa reminds him that Shivgami had declared Mahendra Bahubali king before her death 25 years ago.

          Prabhas in a dual role as
          Amarendra Baahubali, the adoptive heir to the throne of Mahishmati (Telugu) / Magizhmathi (Tamil) and a respected prince by the people for his compassion and nobility.
          Mahendra Baahubali "Sivudu" (Telugu) / "Sivu" (Tamil) (son), Amarendra's son to Devasena who was born during his father's death and grows up to meet the rebel alliance that is combating Bhallaladeva.
          Rana Daggubati as Bhallaladeva (Telugu) / Palvaalthevan (Tamil), Amarendra's biological cousin and adoptive older brother who was extremely jealous of his popularity, and has plotted to erase his right to the throne since childhood. Unlike Baahubali he cares little for his people and is shown to enslave his subjects, and he frames his own assassination to get Kattappa to kill Baahubali.
          Anushka Shetty as Devasena (Telugu) / Devasenai (Tamil), the younger sister of the king of Kuntala, who marries Baahubali. Her inclusion in the royal family and calling out Sivagami's and Palvaalthevan's/ Bhallaladeva's law leads to civil conflict in the kingdom and their exile
          Tamannaah as Avanthika, a young and powerful rebel warrior whom Mahendra falls in love with. She helps him take the kingdom back and they get married.
          Ramya Krishna as Sivagami, Bhallaladeva's / Palvaalthevan's mother and Bijaladeva's / Pingalathevan's wife, and a former subject of the kingdom who rises to become queen. She has one of the highest authorities in the kingdom and is a skilled combatant. She is nearly murdered by her own son as she tries to smuggle Mahendra out of the kingdom.
          Nassar as Bijjaladeva (Telugu) / Pingalathevan (Tamil), the deranged father of Bhallaladeva / Palvaalthevan and husband of Sivagami, he has a broken hand from battle and just like his son he believes in exploiting his subjects and being oppressive. Because of this he was never formally granted control of the kingdom. His brother Vikramadeva is the biological father of Amarendra Baahubali.
          Sathyaraj as Kattappa, a sibling figure to Sivagami and is called an uncle to Bhallaladeva and Amarendra. He's a member of a lineage of incredibly skilled warriors who serve the royal family like servants, but he also authorizes the kingdom's military.
          Subbaraju as Kumara Varma, a relative of Devasena who is competitive against her and is a cowardly warrior, but is motivated by Amarendra to stand up to the Pindari invasion on Kuntala. He is killed by Bijaladeva / Pingalathevan in an elaborate trap to frame Baahubali for treason.
